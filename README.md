## Design Review

### Current implementation

![Current UI](https://github.com/brendandgibson/avatech/blob/master/images/avatech.png)

#### Pros

* The fine selection allows exact degree selection.
* Once the user has used this UI, the actions are memorable.
* Selection can be made in two clicks.
* The compass image is easily understandable.

#### Cons

* It takes a moment for the user to understand the functionality.
* Two compasses looks like overkill.
* Click targets are small.
